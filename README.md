# GUI

WXWIDGETS

For our main GUI i am using the Wxwidgets framework.

within this we will be able to access the various modules

== IBGController - to control actions to and from Interactive brokers.
== Historian - To store, retrieve and analyse public data.
== Accountant - To store, retrieve and analyse PRIVATE data.

I have split these modules up into various repos to try and hide complexity. 
It should be possible to run them autonomously, ie via a command line tester.

Looking forward, i am going to dabble in AI. Hence the framework up front to allow
unsupervised learning.
